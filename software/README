Structure of this directory:

- doc: A repository for all documentation related to the source code
- FreeRTOS: The source code of FreeRTOS
- openDrive: The source code of th openDrive Software
- novas: The source code of the NOVAS library for astronomical claculations
- include: ALL(!) include files
	Include file policy:
	* put an include file in the same directory as the source code,
	  ONLY if no source file outside that directory may refer to it.
	  This condition should only be true for internal definitions etc.
	* Otherwise put your include file into a subdirectory of ./include.
	  Put it into the first level subdirectory of the owning component.
	  e.g. FreeRTOS owned include files can be found in include/FreeRTOS
	* You can safely use #include "myinclude.h" in your source, because 
	  the Makefiles automatically extend the include path, when invoking 
	  the compiler.
	* Use #includeÂ "Component/subdir/hisinclude.h" for including include
	  files owned by other components or subdirectories
	* include/portable/Component contains the platform dependent parts
	  include/Component should only contain platform independent headers.
	
Makefile and Makefile.inc
  The Makefiles are set up in a way, that all source files listed in the
  Makefile in the directories listed in SUBDIRS are automatically checked 
  for their dependecies and attempted to be built to an object (.o) file.
  When building source files from a subdirectory, th subdirectories name
  is automatically prefixed by ./include and that path is appended to the
  -I(include_dir) list for the compiler.
